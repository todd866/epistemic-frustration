## Overview

Complex adaptive systems undergo a predictable lifecycle from exploration to exploitation. In late-stage exploitation, disagreement becomes costly and anomalies are absorbed rather than explored. This is not irrationality---it is **coordination-first epistemics**: optimization under constraint where preserving cooperation dominates truth-seeking.

When high-dimensional optima project into contradictory low-dimensional representations, disagreement is geometric, not epistemic.

## Key Results

- **Epistemic frustration**: The "right answer" in high-D constraint space projects into mutually contradictory positions in low-D discourse
- **Coordination-first transition**: Predictable shift from epistemic-first to coordination-first regimes under high stakes
- **DOF diagnostic for unfalsifiability**: Systems become unfalsifiable when error-model degrees of freedom exceed informational constraints
- **Scale-bound normativity**: Moral intuitions calibrated for local optimization become misleading at global scales

## Running Simulations

```bash
cd code
python3 generate_figures.py      # Generate all figures (includes 3,125 simulation runs for phase diagram)
```
